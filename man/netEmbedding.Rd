\arguments{
\item{object}{CellChat object}

\item{slot.name}{the slot name of object that is used to compute centrality measures of signaling networks}

\item{type}{"functional","structural"}

\item{comparison}{a numerical vector giving the datasets for comparison. No need to define for a single dataset. Default are all datasets when object is a merged object}
